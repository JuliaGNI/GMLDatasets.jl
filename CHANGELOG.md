# Changelog

All notable changes to GMLDatasets.jl are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) (pre-1.0, so a minor bump is a
breaking release).

## [0.1.0]

Initial release. Nothing here is new code — it is the MLDatasets-dependent material extracted from
`GeometricMachineLearning` and `GeometricOptimizers`, both of which are libraries for scientific
machine learning and neither of which should pull in an image-dataset package to document itself.

### Added

- **`src/mnist_utils.jl`**, moved from `GeometricMachineLearning/src/data_loader/mnist_utils.jl`:
  `onehotbatch`, `split_and_flatten` and the index arithmetic behind them (`patch_index`,
  `within_patch_index`, `index_conversion`). These were exported by `GeometricMachineLearning` and
  are now exported here instead.

- **The classification `DataLoader` constructor**, moved from
  `GeometricMachineLearning/src/data_loader/data_loader.jl`:
  `DataLoader(images::AbstractArray{T,3}, labels::AbstractVector)`. Its docstring already described
  itself as "tailored towards being used with the package MLDatasets.jl", which is what made it the
  natural cut. It has to live outside `GeometricMachineLearning` in any case: it is the only way to
  build a `DataLoader` whose input is `Float32` and whose output is `Int`, since the generic
  tensor–tensor constructor requires a single shared element type.

  Its docstring said MNIST images "are of size ``49\times49``", which they are not — they are
  ``28\times28`` and it is the *patches* that are 49-element vectors. Corrected in the move.

- **`src/datasets.jl`**, new: `mnist`, `fashion_mnist`, `mnist_data_loader` and
  `fashion_mnist_data_loader`. The two `*_data_loader` functions replace the
  `MLDatasets.MNIST(split=:train)[:]` / `DataLoader(...)` pair that was hand-copied into every one of
  the eleven scripts collected here.

- **`scripts/gml/`**, moved from `GeometricMachineLearning/scripts/`: `transformer_mnist.jl`,
  `transformer_fashion_mnist.jl`, `transformer_bfgs.jl`, `transformer_analysis.jl`,
  `mnist_grassmann.jl`, `autoencoder.jl`, `classifier.jl` and `convert_jld2_to_h5.jl`.

- **`scripts/geometric_optimizers/`**, moved from `GeometricOptimizers/scripts/`: `mnist.jl` and its
  `_cuda`, `_cuda_repetitions`, `_metal` and `_metal_short` variants, plus
  `distill_mnist_results.jl`, `metal_memory_probe.jl` and the two shell drivers. These spell the
  neural network out by hand rather than using `GeometricMachineLearning`, because
  `GeometricMachineLearning` depends on `GeometricOptimizers` and the dependency cannot be inverted.
  `Metal` is deliberately **not** a dependency of `scripts/Project.toml`: it does not resolve on
  Linux and would leave the whole environment unprecompilable there. Mac users add it by hand.

- **`docs/src/mnist/`**, the MNIST tutorial moved from
  `GeometricMachineLearning/docs/src/tutorials/mnist/`, including the pre-trained parameters
  (`mnist_nn1.h5`–`mnist_nn4.h5`, `mnist_metadata.h5`) so the page reports real numbers without
  retraining, and the TikZ sources for the patch-splitting figure.

- **`docs/src/homogeneous_spaces_experiment.md`**, the numerical experiment moved from
  `GeometricOptimizers/docs/src/manifold_optimizers.md`, with the three CSVs it plots. The theory
  half of that page stayed in `GeometricOptimizers`, where it documents that package's own
  algorithm.

- **`docs/src/running_the_experiments.md`**, the operational half of the former
  `GeometricOptimizers/MNIST_PORT.md`: what the four configurations are for, why one of them is
  expected to fail, and the Metal unified-memory handling the GPU scripts need.
